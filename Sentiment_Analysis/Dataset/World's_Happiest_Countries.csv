@conr2141,"The Scandinavian countries tend to adopt ""moral utilitarianism"" when thinking about society.. Meaning, the goal is to maximize total/aggregate ""well-being"", on the basis of something like Maslow's Hierarchy of needs.. since ""happiness returns"" tend to diminish as a function of wealth once you have the basics covered, it makes more sense covering those basics for as many people as possible, as a 1st priority.. You just basically decide as a society that aggregate well-being is more important than how rich your billionaire class is.",2023-10-24T16:08:10Z,0,0
@kk440635NORWAY,"Money is not the main key to happiness. I am from Norway, alot of people are happy, but there is also alot of unhappy people here. Depression is very common, probably because of mentality and weather, and there is alot of suicide and alcohol problems, and drug addicts, and there is not so much to do here either, because there is poor access to leisure facilities

I have been to poor countries where the citizens have much more to spend their free time on. If you live in the countryside, they have little to offer the residents. In many places you can go for a walk or stay at home, but that's all you can do, and you have poor access to public transport. It goes without saying that many people become depressed when they have bad weather almost all year round, and nothing to spend their time on. Moreover, it is a myth that most people are rich in Norway. Most of them belong to the working class, and even if the amount of income is higher than in many other western countries, one must not forget that Norway is among the most expensive countries in the western world, so then people do not become richer than in many other western countries, as the cost of living is much higher, I would like to emphasize that this does NOT apply to all western countries, there are some WESTERN countries where people have less in accordance with their cost of living

When it comes to healthcare, I would say that it is good in Norway, but not extraordinary or unique. There are many other countries in Europe that have the same system. Spending the night in hospital for free, and receiving free treatment while you are admitted to hospital apply in many places in the western world

All outpatient treatment in public healthcare costs money. It is partially subsidized, but not free, you have to pay a deductible, as in many other countries. Treatment within mental health in the Norwegian public health system has burst capacity with long waiting times, so access to help for those struggling mentally is poor. I know from an earlier period in my own life that help is difficult and scarce, you almost have to be suicidal to get help quickly, if you are not suicidal, but still have major psychological problems, then the waiting time in the public health system is long

I would also like to mention dental health. In Norway, I feel that the teeth are not part of the body. Dentistry is 0% subsidized by the state after you turn 18. Then you pay 100% of the price yourself, as you do in the USA. Dentistry is not part of the Norwegian ordinary healthcare system, it is a ""separate"" healthcare system, without rights. I can't afford to go to the dentist right now, but if I save some money, I might be able to in 3 or 4 months. 

Norway is not a bad country to live in. But it is not perfect or unique either. We are rich in resources, but the people who live here are not rich, but neither are they poor, but of course there are poor and rich, but these two groups are minorities, the working class is the majority of the population

Whether a person is lucky or unlucky is, in my opinion, to a greater extent from person to person than from country to country. But of course you are more fortunate than those who live in war zones or those who are starving, but say you don't live in a war zone, but still in a poor corrupt country and you yourself are poor, but still enough for food and hygiene, you are then less lucky than an average Norwegian? This is impossible to answer, there is no definitive answer, money is not everything, and it all depends on who you ask. Personally, I think it's about what you've experienced in life. 

Even if you live in a rich Western country, you are still not immune to bad experiences in life, and people deal with things differently, and it also has a lot to do with who you surround yourself with. There are cold people here as elsewhere, there are psychopaths here as elsewhere, there are people in mourning who have lost loved ones here as elsewhere, there is abuse here as elsewhere. 

You can be lucky or unlucky anywhere, and in my opinion it varies from country to country, and not from person to person. For example, if you lose someone you love, the grief is just as great in a rich country as it is in a poor country, the dead person does not come back, and the missing is just as great. If you experience traumatic events in Norway, this is no less traumatic than if you experience this in a poor country

Even if Norway has little street crime, I don't think they have less crime inside a house or an apartment with relations. Sick people are found everywhere, these are international problems. Many people in the world are mistreated by so-called ""friends"" or relatives within the 4 walls of the house. This is hardly less widespread in Norway than elsewhere",2023-06-07T22:31:08Z,0,0

@sylviadailey9126,"Wow. I am intrigued. Scandanavia is not just a case of socialism done right, but it is also the happiest. This is something worth studying, because it can help other countries. One part is having more freedom despite having more control by the government. Mind blown! One can really have thier cake and eat it too. They can have both equality and freedom. Maybey it works like this. Big businesses in capitalism have thier own brand of tyranny. It is a tyranny that is less prominent than the political tyranny of a monarch or dictater. A lower class person can't do many things they want because they can't afford it. In a way, the upper class and big buissness puts tyrannical control on the people by pricing them out like this. It gets really bad when people struggle to pay for needed things like food, utility and housing. The socialism of Scandinavia clearly has more equality due to higher taxes and benifits. It does seem to be putting more order as well. I just thought it was part of the territory. Yet now I see. If the government was more generous, people will get all the resources they need. They can even go further and invest in education, Healthcare and family. So they get more personal freedom, because they are not priced out by the rich. Mind blown.

I am an American. I feel so called out. One Scandinavian woman said they are the ones that have the American dream. How ironic. I do like how Scandinavians use teamwork as a buffer against crisis. I wish my country had that too. I am so sick of the polarization. Republicans are arrogant jeks. They refuse to cooperate with Democrates. The situation is shifted so far right that it makes Democrats look like reasonable centrists. The video mentions the happiness of other countries drop due to poverty and political corruption. That is exactly the problem I have in America. I was really happy in my youth. I thrived in high school and college. Then I tried to enter the workforce. I was completely unable to get a decent job. There was struggle with unemployment, recession and poverty. It was so bad, I developed clinical depression. At worst I was suicidal. It is only recently that I show recovery. I became well enough to go on without being treated by a doctor. That was also when I got on SSI for disability. It is interesting whe I was happier benefiting from more governmental things like college and SSI. I got college mostly through government grants and student loans. Now that I am on SSI, I shouldn't have to pay back my loans. This is an interesting case of happiness.",2022-05-08T06:48:41Z,0,0

There’s always 2 sides of the coin. Yeah sure South Korea is probably what it is today because of the USA, but North Korea is also what it is today because of the USA. Why do you think they hate you so much? Why do you think North Korean citizens are told that the USA is the biggest enemy? Always remember that to reach peace, you need to go through misery. You are basically saying the USA is keeping the peace by shooting the people you don’t like. That’s your definition of “keeping the peace”. 

And what do Nordic countries bring to the world. If shooting others is a way to do good for the world then no, Nordic countries aren’t doing much because they don’t hurt anyone. So by American standards they aren’t doing much. But let’s look on the other side of the coin. They accept immigrants, help people who have nothing to get jobs, money, food, a life basically. They send money to poor places every day, sweden sends most money to Tanzania out of everyone to help them grow. And let’s not forget the embassy’s. Sweden has a huge number of international embassies for its tiny population. Did you know sweden is basically the only western country to have an embassy in North Korea? And what do they use it for? To send information to (guess what?) the USA so you can shoot more people and “keep the peace”.",2019-05-14T15:57:08Z,0,

@jjdd19,"It looks like everybody like to talk about ""who is more happy"" but the word ""happy"" and ""happiness"" are really misunderstood on these reports. When checking the sentiments or positive emotions that people are having in their everyday life, the Nordic countries do not rank so well. Why? because happiness does not depend on how the social welfare and state works but more on simple things like family time, friends,  easiness to share with other people, art expressions, freedom to have fun activities, good weather, tasty food, diverse cultural expressions and of course, a system that supports you in the bad times. Finland in its place, has a unique and special State system that takes care of many things like education, unemployment, child support, universal healthcare ... etc. yeah, but another is the face of the non-Public sector and people on the streets. The true is that weather is very harsh during about 6 - 7 months of the year. When talking about harsh is not only talking about just ""cold"" but cold in extreme with strong winds and temperatures that can be about -15 degrees Celsius still on February while other southern countries are already developing the Spring. Days can be gray and dark in weeks without any bliss of sun in the sky. The mood of people, then is very melancholic and gray too. Many people just go away of the country for one, two weeks and even some leave their jobs to travel during 1-3 months to another tropical country with more sun and ""happiness"". Foreigners struggle all the time to get a job just for being foreigners (even with a high level of education and experience abroad) and because of ""not speaking fluently the local language"". Some have found that even talking fluently do not change this. Then again, father State helps (yeah, and it is great, but is that what a person wants always??) . Finnish mentality can be very closed and conservative. This is country of only over 5 million people that has not had long experience with foreigners and taking any kind of labor from abroad even when the Government reports says that it is necessary. The Government works and the State brings the support and does its job very well. But the other part, the people and companies, are very reluctant to change things, to face the future and the new challenges, to be more open and social minded on the street level. There are exceptions, of course, but even those people recognize how hard is to live in Finland even when they just grew up in here.

Small communities tend to be very close-knit while larger towns and cities tend to almost completely lack this factor.

I don't think you should take it as a compliment.
To me the US people seem to be a little under educated.
And being deceived throughout life by governing forces, and the right side. 


US is a  Country with almost none
benefits, 
They don`t have Free Health Care, 
62% don`t go to Doctors because they are afraid of high bills or even Bankruptcy. 
And 32% don`t even have Insurance.
If you change job you loose your 
Health Care.
And America is one of only 3 countries 
Without MATERNITY LEAVE IN THE WORLD.
And no Vacation by law. 
No Free Schools,
but you can work, if you can get a job, 
they have much longer time on work than we do. And you can live on the street.


But If you are not a worker you might do fine.


When you look at the election system,
so created The founding fathers a buffer between the population and the selection of a President. The founding fathers could not trust ordinary people  to choose a President. And they have Gerrymandering.


It would take a constitutional amendment ratified by 3/4 of states to change the system. It is hard to imagine the smaller states agreeing. One way of modifying the system is to eliminate the winner take all part of it. The method that the states vote for the electoral college is not mandated by the constitution but is decided by the states. Two states do not use the winner take all system, Maine and Nebraska. 
It would be difficult but not impossible to get other states to change their systems. Unfortunately, the party that has the advantage in the state is unlikely to agree to a unilateral change. 


There are ongoing attempts to change the system, but few expect them to be successful any time soon.",2019-09-30T23:16:22Z,2,

@kk440635NORWAY,"Money is not the main key to happiness. I am from Norway, alot of people are happy, but there is also alot of unhappy people here. Depression is very common, probably because of mentality and weather, and there is alot of suicide and alcohol problems, and drug addicts, and there is not so much to do here either, because there is poor access to leisure facilities

I have been to poor countries where the citizens have much more to spend their free time on. If you live in the countryside, they have little to offer the residents. In many places you can go for a walk or stay at home, but that's all you can do, and you have poor access to public transport. It goes without saying that many people become depressed when they have bad weather almost all year round, and nothing to spend their time on. Moreover, it is a myth that most people are rich in Norway. Most of them belong to the working class, and even if the amount of income is higher than in many other western countries, one must not forget that Norway is among the most expensive countries in the western world, so then people do not become richer than in many other western countries, as the cost of living is much higher, I would like to emphasize that this does NOT apply to all western countries, there are some WESTERN countries where people have less in accordance with their cost of living

When it comes to healthcare, I would say that it is good in Norway, but not extraordinary or unique. There are many other countries in Europe that have the same system. Spending the night in hospital for free, and receiving free treatment while you are admitted to hospital apply in many places in the western world

All outpatient treatment in public healthcare costs money. It is partially subsidized, but not free, you have to pay a deductible, as in many other countries. Treatment within mental health in the Norwegian public health system has burst capacity with long waiting times, so access to help for those struggling mentally is poor. I know from an earlier period in my own life that help is difficult and scarce, you almost have to be suicidal to get help quickly, if you are not suicidal, but still have major psychological problems, then the waiting time in the public health system is long

I would also like to mention dental health. In Norway, I feel that the teeth are not part of the body. Dentistry is 0% subsidized by the state after you turn 18. Then you pay 100% of the price yourself, as you do in the USA. Dentistry is not part of the Norwegian ordinary healthcare system, it is a ""separate"" healthcare system, without rights. I can't afford to go to the dentist right now, but if I save some money, I might be able to in 3 or 4 months. 

Norway is not a bad country to live in. But it is not perfect or unique either. We are rich in resources, but the people who live here are not rich, but neither are they poor, but of course there are poor and rich, but these two groups are minorities, the working class is the majority of the population

Whether a person is lucky or unlucky is, in my opinion, to a greater extent from person to person than from country to country. But of course you are more fortunate than those who live in war zones or those who are starving, but say you don't live in a war zone, but still in a poor corrupt country and you yourself are poor, but still enough for food and hygiene, you are then less lucky than an average Norwegian? This is impossible to answer, there is no definitive answer, money is not everything, and it all depends on who you ask. Personally, I think it's about what you've experienced in life. 

Even if you live in a rich Western country, you are still not immune to bad experiences in life, and people deal with things differently, and it also has a lot to do with who you surround yourself with. There are cold people here as elsewhere, there are psychopaths here as elsewhere, there are people in mourning who have lost loved ones here as elsewhere, there is abuse here as elsewhere. 

You can be lucky or unlucky anywhere, and in my opinion it varies from country to country, and not from person to person. For example, if you lose someone you love, the grief is just as great in a rich country as it is in a poor country, the dead person does not come back, and the missing is just as great. If you experience traumatic events in Norway, this is no less traumatic than if you experience this in a poor country

Even if Norway has little street crime, I don't think they have less crime inside a house or an apartment with relations. Sick people are found everywhere, these are international problems. Many people in the world are mistreated by so-called ""friends"" or relatives within the 4 walls of the house. This is hardly less widespread in Norway than elsewhere",2023-06-07T22:31:36Z,0,

3)free school with free mid day meals. 
4) incentives for producing 1 or 2 babies. And a fixed deposit for having girl child.

The immigrant people born here learn Norwegian as early as ethnic Norwegians, and since they go to the same school, there is a very low chance that they fall into ghettos. In larger cities, like Malmö or Stavanger, ghettos are more frequent, but in the smaller towns and villages, they integrate very fast.

@lucienenhanced2251,"Melayu Ball mc Islam in its current form is naturally bigoted. The Quran says all Muslims are equal, but it conveniently leaves out non-believers.
